## Adding PSCoachMark to your project

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add PSCoachMark to your project.

1. Add a pod entry for PSCoachMark to your Podfile `pod 'PSCoachMark', :git => 'https://github.com/patricks/PSCoachMark.git'`
2. Install the pod(s) by running `pod install`.
3. Include PSCoachMark wherever you need it with `#import "PSCoachMark.h"`.

### Source files

Alternatively you can directly add the `PSCoachMark.h` and `PSCoachMark.m` source files to your project.

1. Download the [latest code version](https://github.com/patricks/PSCoachMark/archive/master.zip) or add the repository as a git submodule to your git-tracked project. 
2. Open your project in Xcode, then drag and drop `PSCoachMark.h` and `PSCoachMark.m` onto your project (use the "Product Navigator view"). Make sure to select Copy items when asked if you extracted the code archive outside of your project. 
3. Include PSCoachMark wherever you need it with `#import "PSCoachMark.h"`.
